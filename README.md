# python-covid19-notifier
# My first Python project - Covid19 Notifier.

## This little app gives you opportunity to enter a country's name and receive some information about total cases of Covid19 in a particular country (also number of deaths, recovered cases, active cases etc.).
### The data is fetched from [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc).

### You also can download statistics saved in a PDF file. There are stored plots with the data for a country that was chosen to create a PDF.

Have fun!
